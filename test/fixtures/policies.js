  disputes: "# Dispute Resolution\n\n This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve module name\n disputes with other npm publishers.\n\n This document is a clarification of the acceptable behavior outlined in the [npm\n Code of Conduct](conduct.md), and nothing in this document should be interpreted to\n contradict any aspect of the npm Code of Conduct.\n\n ## tl;dr\n\n 1. Get the author email with `npm owner ls <pkgname>`\n 2. Email the author, CC <support@npmjs.com>\n 3. After a few weeks, if there's no resolution, we'll sort it out.\n\n Don't squat on package names.  Publish code or move out of the way.\n "
