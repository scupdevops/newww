  Technology, in whole and in part and all copies thereof, and all
  modifications, enhancements, derivatives and other alterations of the
  Licensed Technology (including, but not limited to, all Intellectual
  Property Rights to the Licensed Technology), whether developed by Licensor,
  Licensee or others, are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of

  modifications.</p>
<p>5.2        Trade
  Secrets.  </p>
<p>        a.        Licensee
  acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Technology (including all
  modifications, enhancements, derivatives and other alterations) is
  confidential and represents Licensor's trade secret.  As a
  result, Licensee (i) will keep the Licensed Technology in strictest
  confidence and (ii) will not use, disclose, provide or otherwise make
  available, directly or indirectly, the Licensed Technology or allow the

  employees of Licensee who have a need to know.  Licensee will promptly
  report to Licensor any infringement of the confidentiality of the Licensed
  Technology of which it becomes aware.  Licensee will further indemnify
  Licensor for any damages, liabilities and expenses arising from a breach of
  this Section 5.2 by Licensee or its agents, and will take such steps as
  necessary to remedy any such breach.  Licensee will identify every
  person to whom the Licensed Technology has been made available in
  accordance the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will fully
  cooperate with Licensor in seeking injunctive or other relief against such
  person if such Licensed Technology is improperly used in violation of the
  terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>        b.        The
  obligations of Licensee under this Section 5.2 do not apply to information
  that Licensee can demonstrate (i) was in its possession at the time of
  disclosure without confidentiality restrictions; (ii) at the time of
  disclosure by Licensor is generally available to the public or after
  disclosure becomes generally available to the public through no breach of
  agreement or other wrongful act by Licensee; provided, however, such
  information remains subject to confidentiality obligations regardless of
  its availability to the public or availability through unauthorized
  disclosure; (iii) was received from a third party without restriction on
  disclosure and without breach of agreement or other wrongful act by
  Licensee; or (iv) is independently developed by Licensee without reference
  to the confidential information of Licensor</p>
<p>        c.        In
  the event Licensee is required by law, regulation, stock exchange
  requirement or legal process to disclose any of Licensor's
  confidential information, Licensee must (i) give Licensor, to the
  extent possible, reasonable advance notice prior to disclosure so Licensor
  may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order, and
  (ii) reasonably limit the disclosure to the minimum amount that is
  legally required to be disclosed..</p>
<p>5.3        Intellectual
  Property Notices.  Licensee will not delete or
  in any manner alter the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights
  notices of Licensor and its licensors, if any, appearing on the Licensed
  Technology as delivered to Licensee.  Licensee will reproduce such
  notices on all copies it makes of the Licensed Technology and on all
  documentation accompanying the Licensed Technology.</p>
<p>6.        No Warranty;
  Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>6.1        No
  Warranty.  LICENSEE

  WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE OR KIND WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
  PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS IN
  CONNECTION WITH, OR ARISING OUT OF, DELIVERING, INSTALLING, FURNISHING,
  MAINTAINING, SUPPORTING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>6.2        Limitation of
  Liability.  EXCEPT FOR ANY BREACH OF EACH
  PARTY'S CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS AND EACH PARTY'S RESPECTIVE
  INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER PARTY IS LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF
  TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR
  LOST PROFITS, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR THE LIKE, EACH OF WHICH IS HEREBY EXCLUDED BY
  AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE OR
  WHETHER THE OTHER PARTY HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.
  EXCEPT FOR LICENSOR'S RESPECTIVE INDEMNIFICATION
  OBLIGATIONS, LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER
  THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO ANY FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE
  HEREUNDER.  THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN
  THIS SECTION 6 WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED
  IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
  PURPOSE.</p>
<p>7.        INDEMNIFICATION.
</p>
<p>7.1        By Licensee.
  Licensee agrees that it shall, at its own
  expense, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its Affiliates
  (the "Licensor Indemnitees") from any liability, damage, cost, claim, or expense
  (including attorney's fees) of any kind arising out of or in
  connection with any third party claim brought against any Licensor
  Indemnitee based upon (a) Licensee's use of the Licensed Technology
  in a manner not authorized by this Agreement, and/or (b) any alleged breach
  of the provisions of Sections 3 or 5 of this Agreement.  </p>
<p>7.2        By Licensor.
  Licensor agrees that it shall, at its own
  expense, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensee and its Affiliates
  (the "Licensee Indemnitees") from any liability, damage, cost, claim, or expense
  (including attorney's fees) of any kind arising out of or in
  connection with any third party claim brought against any Licensee
  Indemnitee based upon (a) any allegation that the Licensed Technology
  provided pursuant to this Agreement infringes any patents, copyrights or
  other proprietary rights of any third party, provided that Licensor is
  promptly notified, rendered reasonable assistance by Licensee as may be
  requested by Licensor at Licensor's expense, and is permitted to
  direct the defense or settlement negotiations for such action.
</p>
<p>7.3        Procedure.        Each
  Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement (the
  "Indemnified Party") agrees to (i) promptly notify the other Party providing
  indemnification (the "Indemnifying
  Party") in writing of any indemnifiable
  claim, and (ii) give the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to defend or
  negotiate a settlement of any such claim at such Indemnifying Party's
  expense and cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party, at such
  Indemnifying Party's expense, in defending or settling such claim.
  Each Indemnified Party reserves the right, at its own expense, to
  participate in the defense of any matter otherwise subject to
  indemnification by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
  have the right to settle any claim for which indemnification is available;
  provided, however, that to the extent that such settlement requires the
  Indemnified Party to take or refrain from taking any action or purports to
  obligate the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall not
  settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
  Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
  delayed.</p>

  Termination.  </p>
<p>8.1        Term and

  reorganization, readjustment or rearrangement of its business or affairs
  under any laws or governmental regulations relating to bankruptcy or
  insolvency, or is adjudicated a bankrupt or if a receiver is appointed for
  either Party, or if either Party makes or attempts an assignment for the
  benefit of creditors, or is unable to meet its or their obligations in the
  normal course of business as they fall due; or (iv) by either Party in the
  event a Party ceases to do business for any reason.  Each Party agrees

  copies of the Licensed Technology (including, but not limited to, any
  copies thereof) in its possession or control.  Except in the event of
  termination by Licensor pursuant to Section 8.2, upon early termination of
  this Agreement, Licensee shall be entitled to a prorated refund for full
  months unused. </p>
<p>8.5        Survival of
  Obligations.  The provisions of Sections 1
  (Definitions), 5 (Fees; Taxes; Expenses), 6 (Proprietary Rights), 7 (No

  enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement will not be
  affected.</p>
<p>        11.3        Waiver.

  Agreement.  This Agreement, along with the
  attached Exhibit, is the complete and exclusive agreement between the
  Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding and

  Fees; Injunctive Relief.   With regard to
  any legal proceedings arising under or in connection with this Agreement by
  any Party, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable
  attorneys' fees, costs and other related expenses.  Licensee
  acknowledges that the disclosure of the Licensed Technology (including all
  modifications, enhancements, derivatives and other alterations) would cause
  substantial harm to Licensor that could not be remedied by payment of
  damages alone.  Accordingly, Licensor will be entitled to preliminary

  exclusion of other remedies.</p>
<p>        11.10        Full Power.
  Each Party warrants that it has full power to
  enter into and perform this Agreement, and the person signing this
  Agreement on each Party's behalf has been duly authorized and
  empowered to enter into this Agreement.</p>
<p>        11.11        Relationship of the
  Parties.  The relationship of the Parties
  hereto is one of contract only, and in no event shall the Parties be
  construed as partners, joint venturers, agents or principals of each
  other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>        11.12        Counterparts.

  in two or more counterparts, each of which will be considered an original,

  instrument.</p>
